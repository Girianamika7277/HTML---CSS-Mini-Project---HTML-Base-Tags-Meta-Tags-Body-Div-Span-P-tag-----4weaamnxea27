      <h2>Paragraph one</h2>
      <p>
        Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. 
       "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to
                     life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part 
                     of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often 
                     understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.The word nature 
                     is borrowed from the Old French nature and is derived from the Latin word natura,
                      or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant "birth".

      <h2>Paragraph Two</h2>
      <p>
       
        Being neutral sounds kind of boring. But neutrality is really important in some cases:
                    Judges, for example, must remain totally neutral when hearing a case. Manners mavens 
                    say that it's best to remain neutral when topics like politics and religion come up 
                    during a party. And boxers can look to the neutral corners in the ring to escape a punch.

      <p>
        Will you hold the line
        When every one of them has given up and given in? Tell me
        In this house of mine
        Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
        Will the stars align?
        Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin, will it?
        'Cause this house of mine stands strong
        That's the price you pay
        Leave behind your heart and cast away
        Just another product of today
        Rather be the hunter than the prey.
